# Bring Back The Old Fav Star Button 

A little Chrome extension to kill the brand new Like Button (argh, i really hate that heart)

#### Notes:
- Stability: Works on my machine, i promisse.
- Code: Ugly, i promisse that too (I will fix it ASAP).
- Why?: I dunno, i think i don't like changes (UI changes, for sure).

## Install

This is a chrome extension, duh.
Just type 'chrome://extensions/' on your navigation bar, press enter, drop the .CRX file in that window and press some ok buttons.

 - "But where do i get that .CRX file?"
  - Argh, from [here](https://github.com/vlntdds/BringBackFavStar/releases/download/v0.1/bringbackfav.crx).
